Repository related to the Genetic Algorithm Course
This repository contains different algorithms for aproximating the global minima of 4 different functions (De Jong's, Schwefel's, Rastrigin's and Michalewicz's) and an attempt of aproximating SAT instances.
Results and an in-depth analysis are presented as a structured report in the pdf files attached.
